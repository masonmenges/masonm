## Anxiety in Gamers

Anxiety is a relatable topic for pretty much anyone driven by numerous factors that are ultimately different for each of us while looking for research related to this topic I found a dataset for a global survery performed by the Center for Open Science. In the study researchers gathered data related to Anxiety, Life satisfaction, and Social phobias in gamers by asking survey participants simple screening questions used to generate scores for General Anxiety Disorder, Satisfaction with Life, and Social Phobias Inventory in addition to various questions related to the their playstyles, lifestyles and habits. It should be noted that while these screening questions are informative they are not a substitute for Diagnosis they are simply a measurement of a persons Level of anxiety at the time the questions were asked.

After exploring the data I noticed that the Survey had included a question for participants playstyles in regards to whether or not they focus on Singleplayer games vs Multiplayer games or both So I decided I wanted to know if there was a difference in anxiety scores of gamers who Primarily play Multiplayer games vs Singleplayer games. I chose to use the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Score as a way to measure this, for context the scores range between 0 and 21, a Score of; 0-4 indicates minimal Anxiety; 5-9 indicates mild anxiety; 10-14 indicates moderate anxiety and a score of 15-21 indicates severe anxiety.

Data was originally gathered by Marian Sauter and Dejan Draschkow.
